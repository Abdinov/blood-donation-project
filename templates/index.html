                        According to <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/give/give-blood" style="color: black">
                            the University of Chicago Medicine</a>
                        , about one in seven people entering a hospital needs
                        blood, and blood is needed every two seconds. More than 4.5 million Americans will need blood
                        transfusion each year. It cannot be manufactured or replaced with a different substance.
                        Individuals who are accident victims, surgery patients, hemophiliacs, or cancer patients depend
                        on a sufficient supply of blood in hospitals. Donating blood is a moral duty of every citizen,
                        especially because Only 37 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood â€” less
                        than 10 percent do it annually. Those who can donate can save lives that otherwise will be lost
                        to a depleted blood supply.

                    Donating blood can have both positive emotional and physical effects on the donor.
                    A blood donor makes an act of altruism, which can ultimately help to save a
                    patient's life.
                    According to a report by the <a

                            Additionally, giving blood can reduce harmful iron stores in people who suffer
                            hemochromatosis.
                            One in every two hundred people in the U.S. is affected by this condition which
                            causes an iron overload.
                            High levels of iron can lead to cancer, heart attacks, or problems associated with
                            the liver; donating blood can
                            help to prevent all of the following diseases caused by high iron levels.
                            Another benefit of donating your blood is getting your heart into better shape.
                            Donating lowers the viscosity of your blood which reduces the friction on your
                            arteries and blood vessels. Watch an interview with David DeRose, MD, to learn more about
                            the benefits of blood donation.

                <p> In November 2019, the Red Cross issued an immediate call for blood donations due to
                    a severe blood shortage.
                    This is not the first and not the last time. At one point, when the COVID-19 pandemic
                    was at its peak in the U.S.,
                    33 percent of hospitals had just a day's supply of blood on their shelves to handle
                    the needs of
                    their patients and zero hospitals have it for more than three days. To learn more about the
                    shortages during COVID-19 pandemic, you can watch the video below.

                <p style="padding-top: 30px;">
                    The fundamental reason for the crisis is not just a decline in the frequency of
                    donors. There has been a decline in the number of donors too.
                    What started as a civic duty-driven phenomenon, has changed into more of an
                    "individual transformational impact".
                    Individuals simply do not want to donate when the incentive is not direct; donors
                    want to know exactly how and whom they helped.
                    The industry is also seeing a decline because there isn't enough awareness being
                    created to reach out to
                    and keep existing younger donors, the millennials. This is why you need to become a
                    donor.

                <h6>What to do before donating blood?</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a donation type and find a convenient time that works best for you.</ui>
                    <li>Have iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish, poultry, beans, spinach,
                        iron-fortified cereals, or raisins</ui>
                    <li>Get a good night's sleep the night before your donation, eat healthy foods and
                        drink extra liquids</ui>
                    <li>Avoid exercise or strenuous activities</ui>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stay in a refreshments area for 15-20 minutes and enjoy a cool drink and savory
                        snack</ui>
                    <li>Drink plenty of fluids</ui>
                    <li>Donâ€™t stand for long periods</ui>
                    <li>Try not to overheat</ui>
                    <li>Avoid exercise or strenuous activities</ui>
                    <li>Avoid alcohol</ui>
                    <li>Avoid strenuous exercise</ui>
                </ul>
                <h6>Are there any risks associated with donating blood?</h6>
                <p>Some of the side effects of donating blood include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bruising</ui>
                    <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea</ui>
                    <li>Physical weakness</ui>
                    <li>Pain in the arm</ui>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, all of the above side effects are temporary and fade away after some time.
                    These side effects are nothing compared to the good that's being done by donating blood.
