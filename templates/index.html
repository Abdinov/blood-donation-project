                <p>Donating blood can have both positive emotional and physical effects on the donor.
                    A blood donor makes an act of altruism, which can ultimately help to save a
                    patient's life.
                    According to a report by the <a

                    Another benefit of donating your blood is getting your heart into a better shape.

                <p> In November 2019, the Red Cross issued an immediate call for blood donations due to
                    a severe blood shortage.
                    This is not the first and not the last time.At one point, when the COVID-19 pandemic
                    was at its peak in the U.S.,
                    33 percent of hospitals had just a day's supply of blood on their shelves to handle
                    the needs of
                    their patients and zero hospitals have it for more than three days.</p>
                <p>The fundamental reason for the crisis is not just a decline in the frequency of
                    donors. There has been a decline in the number of donors too.
                    What started as a civic duty-driven phenomenon, has changed into more of an
                    "individual transformational impact".
                    Individuals simply do not want to donate when the incentive is not direct; donors
                    want to know exactly how and whom they helped.
                    The industry is also seeing a decline because there isn't enough awareness being
                    created to reach out to
                    and keep existing younger donors, the millennials. This is why you need to become a
                    donor.</p>

                <h6>What to do before donating blood?</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a donation type and find a convenient time that works best for you.</ui>
                    <li>Have iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish, poultry, beans, spinach,

                    <li>Get a good night's sleep the night before your donation, eat healthy foods and

                    <li>Avoid exercise or strenuous activities</ui>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stay in a refreshments area for 15-20 minutes and enjoy a cool drink and savoury
                        snack</ui>
                    <li>Drink plenty of fluids</ui>
                    <li>Don’t stand for long periods</ui>
                    <li>Try not to overheat</ui>
                    <li>Avoid exercise or strenuous activities</ui>
                    <li>Avoid alcohol</ui>
                    <li>Avoid strenuous exercise</ui>
                </ul>
                <h6>Are there any risks associated with donating blood?</h6>
                <p>Some of the side effects of donating blood include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bruising</ui>
                    <li>Dzziness, lightheadedness, and nausea</ui>
                    <li>Physical weakness</ui>
                    <li>Pain in the arm</ui>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, all of the above side effects are temporary, and fade away after some time.
                    These side effects are nothing compared to the good - saving someone's life - that
                    is being done with donating blood.

                                    was at its peak in the U.S.,
                                    33 percent of hospitals had just a day's supply of blood on their shelves to handle
                                    the needs of
                                    their patients and zero hospitals have it for more than three days.</p>
                                <p>The fundamental reason for the crisis is not just a decline in the frequency of
                                    donors. There has been a decline in the number of donors too.
                                    What started as a civic duty-driven phenomenon, has changed into more of an
                                    "individual transformational impact".
                                    Individuals simply do not want to donate when the incentive is not direct; donors
                                    want to know exactly how and whom they helped.
                                    The industry is also seeing a decline because there isn't enough awareness being
                                    created to reach out to
                                    and keep existing younger donors, the millennials. This is why you need to become a
                                    donor.</p>

                                    <li>Bruising</ui>
